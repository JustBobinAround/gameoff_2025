# GAME SCREENPLAY

## Setting: Darkness

[PLAYER]

Huh, where am I? I can't see. Hello?

[UNKNOWN VOICE]

Blind, deaf, and perhaps dumb although not mute. Silly human...

[PLAYER]

I don't know who you are or what kind of joke this is, but can you please turn the lights on?

[UNKNOWN VOICE]

Oh... So someone can finally hear me after all these years. And to think it
would be a child like you. Figures.

There are no lights in a place like this. Although you being able to hear me has
my interest. I think I'm going to stick around for a bit. It seems fate wants us
to be close.

[PLAYER]

Fine! Just tell me how to leave this place!

[UNKNOWN VOICE]

*Sigh...* You'll wake up soon enough.

On a separate note, during the choosing ceremony today, you should let **Emma** go before you.

[PLAYER]

Wait how do you know Emma?

*click*

## Setting: Player Wakes Up in their room within their parents house

[PLAYER]

What a strange dream.

[MOM]

Oh thank goodness you're finally awake. I was yelling at the top of my lungs and
you just wouldn't wake up. You're going to be late to the choosing ceremony if
you don't hurry up and get to the **Hall of Elders**. Get going!

## Setting: Hall of Elders

[Emma]

Late as always... Not like it matters. I'm going to be chosen as this year's
scavenger and you know it.

[Elders]

As you all know, every year we stand here on this day to choose the roles
of each of our kin as they come of age and to honor our great *Dauerlicht*
that gives us the light we need to grow crops. This has always been the way and has
allowed this town to survive within the depths of this labyrinth for centuries.
We may not know how we got here or how to return to the overworld, but know that
it takes everyone for us to survive and we must all make sacrifices. May your
debt to the past be payed forward and let this choosing cerimony commense!

Now who wants to come first? Don't be shy.

*Player is given choice:*
- Go first
- Let Emma go first.

*Unknown character enters and kills player or emma depending on choice.*
[UNKNOWN CHARACTER]
I'm sorry to interupt this ceremony, but I require your great *Dauerlicht*.

Unknown character steals the **Dauerlicht** and everything switches to darkness.

*Note: Shadow shader pipline should be switch on after this event*

### If Player goes first - Player is killed and greeted by the unknown voice:

[UNKNOWN VOICE]

See, this is why you should listen to me. Nothing good ever happens otherwise...

This one time I'll help you without a cost.

*Restart button is shown*

### If Player lets Emma go first - Emma is killed, elders are dying, unknown character leaves

*Player approaches elder*

[LAST ALIVE ELDER]

You must retrieve the *Dauerlicht*! Without it, we will all die here! It was the towns protection and
without it, we may as well be on any floor of the dungeon. Its too late. The waves are already starting!

Here, take this.

*player recieves sword and a light*

I give you the title of scavenger. You are to retrieve the *Dauerlicht* at all costs and protect the town.

*Elder dies*

[UNKNOWN VOICE]

This isn't looking too good. You see that alter up there. Your elders might not
know it, but those are the heart of a dungeon layer. It can let us get to the
next layer in the dungeon, but it also is what is attracting the monsters. If
you kill at least three wave of monsters I can take over the alter and stop
this mess.

*player starts fighting waves*

### Once player wins - Portal opens.

[UNKNOWN VOICE]
That was easy enough. We need to go after the *Dauerlicht*. Like your elder
said, without it, this town will die. I'll keep the portal open, you go ahead and
get anything you need. Its going to be a long journey to the overworld.

[PLAYER]
Why are you helping me?

[UNKNOWN VOICE]
I haven't had someone that could hear or see me for decades. Its just nice to
be able to finally talk to someone again.

[PLAYER]
...

[UNKNOWN VOICE]
Come on, I've helped you so far. Now hurry up, I can't keep this thing open forever.

### Player enters portal

[UNKNOWN VOICE]
So here's the thing. I'd say we're at least 20 levels below the overworld. Each
level we need to find one of those alters like the one you saw in the hall of
elders. The quicker we find each alter and beat the waves it makes, the quicker
we'll reach the surface.
